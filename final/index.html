    <h2>Try meditinspiritation today!</h2><p>Meditinspiritation revolutionizes the way you achieve spiritual nirvana, and the way you prepare for your workday, and the way you relax after a hard workout, and the way you hang out with your friends, family, relatives, pets, garden gnomes, sworn enemies, Platonic ideals of the objects that surround you, and every other thing you could possibly be hanging out with. </p><p> Meditinspiritation, founded in 2015, is a new way of attacking the all-too familiar and similar problems of meditation and inspiration. When you wake up in the morning, do you feel tired, burt out, or like you're failing to achieve spiritual enlightenment? When you go to work, do you dread the stress and the nihilistic agony that your work day brings? With Meditinspiritation, this will all change. Just a few minutes of Meditinspiritation a day has proven to cause euphoria, excitement, rejuvenation and the feeling of being at peace with onesself and the world around them (in in-vitro studies). Try it today!</p>
