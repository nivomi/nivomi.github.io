    <h3>What is Meditinspiritation?</h3><p>Meditinspiritation, a combination of meditation and inspiration, brings you the best of both worlds - the serene, calming peace of meditation, and the drive to achieve of inspiration. </p><p>We use some of the most inspiring quotes and music to enhance your meditinspiritation experience. You might be thinking, "hey, aren't inspiring music and quotes contrary to the entire idea of meditation?" But you're wrong! Our carefully engineered software allows for the perfect blend of calming and power-fueling, using haikus and proverbs to keep you serene while filling you with contemporary and idealistic drive to succeed! The music, carefully handpicked and with a large enough catologue that you'll never hear the same song twice, is so pleasant and calm that you'll be able to slip into nirvana with ease, while still keeping you grounded when it comes to your goals and aspirations.</p><p>Here at Meditinspiritation, we've thought of everything, so that you can sit back, relax, and dream big.
